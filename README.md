## Analysing-crop-yields-and-predicting-food-sustainability-of-nations-in-near-future

This is the backyard of Badass Datenjungs, herzlich willkommen!

In the beginning we wanted to use crop yield data from kaggle and satelite images from google earth engine to anaylze and predict future crop yield.
Unfortunately the kaggle data was of low qualty and many other teams predicted crop yield from satellite data before us. We now settled on predicting
undernourishment in a given coutry in percent. We use climate data (earth engine), economic data (FAO and World Bank) and violent conflict data (UCDP)
to do so. Feel free to have a look around :)

Description of files:

Misc -> old stuff that we will probably delete in the end

Dataset Construction -> Steps and datasets that are needed to build our final dataset, combining climate, economics and conflict data

Earth Engine Data Collection -> As the name suggests, python scripts that collect data from google earth engine

Models -> Analysing and making predictions with our self-created dataset
